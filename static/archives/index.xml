      <description>Class Sessions in the Archives Faculty are encouraged to incorporate materials from the Archives into their teaching. There are multiple, scalable options for curricular use of collections and the Archivists are available to work with you to achieve your pedagogical goals. These include:
 A single class visit to the archives to orient students to the collections and space A thematic visit to the archives, with selections on a particular topic, subject, or theme An assignment designed around collections that requires out-of-class student visits to the archives An entire class or syllabus built around archival collections  In all these scenarios, our instruction focuses both on enabling students to find and use collections, and developing their skills in analyzing and interpreting primary sources.</description>
