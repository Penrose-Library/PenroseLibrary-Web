Beginning July 2, 2018, Sherlock 2.0 will become our default interface for library searching and discovery. This Orbis Cascade Alliance-wide effort strives to improve your experience in discovery and access of our library collections. You may already be familiar with this interface; it has been available for preview since January 2018. Sherlock 2.0 has some new and updated features, including:
<ol>
 	<li>Pinning items you are interested in, then easily sending your pinned list to your email or citation manager.</li>
 	<li>Seeing and exporting citations with one click from the record.
More functionality and easier browsing from your mobile device.</li>
</ol>
We welcome comments and suggestions on how we could improve your experience at Penrose Library. Please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:sherlock@whitman.edu">sherlock@whitman.edu</a>.
