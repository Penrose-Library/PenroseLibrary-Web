## National Recognition of Academic Libraries That Are Making a Difference for All Underrepresented Groups

Whitman College Penrose Library received the 2025 Library Excellence in Access and Diversity (LEAD) Award from Insight Into Diversity magazine, the largest and oldest diversity and inclusion publication in higher education. The LEAD Award honors academic libraries’ programs and initiatives that encourage and support inclusive excellence and belonging across their campus. These include, but are not limited to research, technology, accessibility, exhibitions, and community outreach. Whitman College Penrose Library is featured, along with 33 other recipients, in the [March 2025](https://www.insightintodiversity.com/wp-content/media/digitalissues/march2025/index.html) issue of Insight Into Diversity magazine.

Insight Into Diversity magazine selected Whitman College, Penrose Library because as a library team, Penrose has dedicated their work over the past several years to create more diverse and inclusive spaces, collections, staffing, services, programming, workflows, and policies. The work completed through the PLEIAD (Penrose Library Equity Inclusion Accessibility and Diversity) working group has expanded towards all aspects of their work. By learning and engaging in discussion together, they are challenging themselves to consider new perspectives and think differently about their work and responsibilities. All staff members of Penrose Library are committed to fostering inclusive excellence in all aspects of their work. 

“We know that many academic libraries are not always recognized for their dedication to diversity, inclusion, and access” says Lenore Pearlstein, owner and publisher of Insight Into Diversity magazine. We are proud to honor these college and university libraries as role models for other institutions of higher education.”
