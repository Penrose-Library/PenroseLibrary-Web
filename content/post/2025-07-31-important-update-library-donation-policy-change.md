Dear Whitman Community,

We want to express our sincere gratitude for your ongoing support and generosity. Over the years, your donations of books and other physical materials have helped enrich our collection and support the college’s teaching and learning needs.

To ensure we continue to steward our resources effectively, Penrose Library will no longer be accepting donations to the general collection. This change aligns with best practices adopted by many academic libraries to ensure the responsible use of space, staff time, and other resources. It also allows us to focus on maintaining and curating our existing holdings in alignment with current academic needs. Please note: This update only applies to the general collection. The Whitman College and Northwest Archives will continue to welcome donations related to College or regional history, as well as materials appropriate for special collections.

We know many of you have donated in the past, and we remain deeply grateful. If you're looking for other places to contribute materials, the following organizations may be of interest:
