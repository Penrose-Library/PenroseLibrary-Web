## Library Accessibility Statement

We strive to support all patrons in accessing library materials and services. If you have any questions or concerns, please [contact the library](https://library.whitman.edu/contact_librarystaff/). We value your feedback.

Penrose Library is committed to providing equitable access to library collections, services, and facilities for all library users as stated in the Penrose Library’s [Mission and Values statement](https://library.whitman.edu/about_the_library/#penrose-mission-and-values-statement) and the Whitman College [Strategic Priorities.](https://www.whitman.edu/newsroom/archive/2017/strategic-priorities) Penrose Library endeavors to follow universal design principles and create physical and digital environments that address the needs of the broadest range of patrons possible by following the best practices and standards for accessibility. For web pages and systems under our direct control, we will work to update them to adhere to [WCAG 2.0.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) For materials and systems licensed from third-party vendors, we will communicate issues brought to our attention with the vendors and work with them to address deficiencies. Penrose Library seeks to select and acquire, whenever possible, resources and technologies that are in line with universal design principles.

## Physical Accessibility

There is one elevator in Penrose Library that reaches all four floors. It is located near the bathrooms. If needed in an emergency, there is a staff elevator that goes from a staff-only entrance near the loading dock (accessible via ramp), which goes between the first and third floors.

Accessible restrooms are located on every floor of the building. The all-gender, single-occupant bathroom is located on the fourth floor, near the elevator. 

Please let library staff know if you need assistance retrieving materials from the shelf or shifting the moveable shelving. You may request Penrose items through [Sherlock](https://sherlock.whitman.edu/discovery/search?vid=01ALLIANCE_WHITC:WHITC_NEW&lang=en) via the “Request for pickup at circ desk” option available once you have logged in. These items are pulled at regular intervals throughout the day, but may not be immediately available. You will receive an email when they are available for you at the Circulation Desk. Please contact the Circulation Desk in person, via email at [ill@whitman.edu](mailto:ill@whitman.edu), or over the phone (509) 527-5192, for more immediate assistance.

There is a height-adjustable desk on the main (2nd) floor by the elevator. It is moveable, and staff can help move it if needed. It can be moved to other floors. The Archives (130) and CTL (313) classrooms have height-adjustable tables. 

[Building Maps](https://library.whitman.edu/map/) are available digitally, and printable in landscape mode.

### Archives Physical Accessibility

The Whitman College and Northwest Archives is located on the first floor, one floor below the main floor and accessible via either stairwell or the elevator. The archives is open [by appointment only](https://wcna.youcanbook.me/) Monday through Friday, 9 am – 12pm, 1 pm - 4 pm. If you have any accommodations you’d like us to know about, please include them in your appointment request. 

## Penrose Social Story

The [Penrose Library Social Story](<https://works.whitman.edu/socialstory >) \[link opens a PDF] is a guide with pictures and descriptions of our physical spaces and resources. It serves as a pre-visit guide if you are nervous or hesitant about the library. Traditionally created for people who are neurodivergent, social stories aid any patron who would like to know what to expect before heading our way.

## Study Spaces

Penrose has a variety of spaces conducive to different needs. There are group and single study rooms available on a first-come, first-serve basis via key check-out at the Circulation Desk. These are prioritized for students and are checked out for 3 hours, with one additional 3 hour renewal available. When classes are not in session, such as over the summer break, these spaces are unlocked and available for anyone to use.

The Allen Reading Room and the 3rd floor atrium near the Reading Room are the only spaces designated as quiet spaces. All quiet spaces are marked by a sign. Throughout the library, and at different times of day, you may find some areas are louder or quieter than others. While we do not have a noise policy, we do expect noise levels to remain respectful and mindful of others. If there are disruptive noises or patrons near you, please let the Circulation staff know.

Ear plugs are available for free at the Circulation Desk. 

### Building tours

Individualized building tours may be arranged by contacting [the library](https://library.whitman.edu/contact_librarystaff/). 

## Digital Accessibility

Many of the library's ebooks, journal archives, and database platforms offer additional support or 'accessibility modes' on request. Some may be enabled directly with a screen reader. You may also need to work with the Academic Resource Center if you have received accommodations to get accessible formats. 

There is a scanner available near the printers on the main (2nd) floor that has adjustments for DPI, color, output file type, etc. Scans can be sent by email. A photocopier is also available next to the printers, you can use your Whitman ID to make scans for 10 cents a page.

Many PDFs delivered via Interlibrary Loan (ILL) have undergone an automated optical character recognition (OCR) process. However, if you receive materials from Penrose that are not accessible, please fill out the [document remediation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQ2N29D31VdMwPZ6Fex9HvWTbwfNxnb_i-212wlHxr46V_gg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to the best of your ability or contact us at library@whitman.edu. See below for more information.

Penrose Library will attempt to the best of our ability to provide patrons alternative formats or assistance when resources are not fully accessible. Please fill out the [remediation form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQ2N29D31VdMwPZ6Fex9HvWTbwfNxnb_i-212wlHxr46V_gg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to the best of your ability or contact us at library@whitman.edu with questions. We will try to fill requests in as timely a manner as possible. This form is sent to Emily Pearson (Instructional Coordinator and Outreach Librarian). We will maintain the data to find patterns in inaccessible material, but will not keep records of who requested materials once we fulfill a request.
