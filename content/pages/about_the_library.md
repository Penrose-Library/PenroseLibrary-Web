## DEIA Statement

Penrose Library supports Whitman College's [Diversity Statement](https://www.whitman.edu//about/policies-and-statements), statements from the American Library Association on [Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion](https://www.ala.org/advocacy/ala-and-affiliate%C2%A0equity-diversity-and-inclusion-statements), and Society of American Archivists' [Statement on Diversity Equity and Inclusion](https://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-statement-on-diversity-equity-and-inclusion). Furthermore, we stand in solidarity with colleagues from [BCALA](https://www.bcala.org/press-release-bcala-statement-to-ala-council-against-racism), [APALA](https://www.apalaweb.org/apala-statement-against-racism-and-harassment/), and [REFORMA](https://www.reforma.org/bcalasolidarity) who have articulated critiques and extensions of these statements. The prejudices, injustices, oppression, and violence that arise from racism do not belong here. As a library, we affirm that information is power; that equity, diversity, and inclusion make our institution stronger; and that individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives enrich our environment. We acknowledge that the library and archival professions remain predominantly white, and because of this uncomfortable truth, we aim to identify and challenge racism and white supremacy, while striving towards supporting diversity in our fields. We acknowledge that these efforts are ongoing, continuous, and inform all aspects of our work.

Because we acknowledge these realities, we strive to amplify voices of diversity within our collections, and also aspire to champion equity by identifying and building out areas in which our collections are lacking, and thereby enrich the educational goals of the College. We aim to provide equitable access to our collections, programs, and services independent of gender identity, sexuality, race, ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic class, disability, religion, spirituality, and age cohort. We seek to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion within the library, and are committed to partnering with communities on-campus and elsewhere who share these goals. We are advocates of freedom of expression and welcome conversations from library patrons and colleagues; we do not tolerate hate speech. We invite dialogue, encourage research, and support educational initiatives that align with these objectives. 

Please consult our [DEIA Actions](/deiaactions) page for more information.

## Gifts to Penrose Library

Gifts to Penrose Library are very welcomed and valued. Through the generous support of friends and alumni, donations to the Library have helped build outstanding collections. Gifts, often those that memorialize or honor loved ones, continue to help foster the traditions of scholarship, critical thinking, and lifelong learning that are hallmarks of a Whitman education. Modest gifts are very much appreciated, as are bequests, endowments and larger contributions.

### General Policy

The general collection does not accept material donations at this time. Please contact Head of Collection Strategies, Lindsay Tebeck, at [tebeckl@whitman.edu](mailto:tebeckl@whitman.edu) if you would like a list of alternative locations that may benefit from your donation.

#### Special Collections Materials

Gifts of manuscript collections, rare books, and unique historic materials, especially those that pertain to Whitman College and northwest regional history, are encouraged. Before such items or materials are donated to the Whitman College and Northwest Archives, please consult with Alexis Hickey, Archivist and Special Collections Librarian (509-526-4731 or hickeya@whitman.edu). The Development Office encourages donors to consider providing financial support for the processing and preservation of such donated materials, especially if the collection is of substantial size and/or significance.

#### General Library Materials

As of July 2025, Penrose Library will no longer accept donations of materials for the general collection. 

This change aligns with best practices adopted by many academic libraries to ensure the responsible use of space, staff time, and other resources. By focusing on curated, demand-driven acquisitions, we can better support the evolving needs of teaching, learning, and research at Whitman College. Materials no longer accepted include—but are not limited to—books, DVDs, CDs, magazines, and other physical media.

If you would like a list of local organizations that may benefit from your donation, please contact Lindsay Tebeck, Head of Collection Strategies, at [tebeckl@whitman.edu](mailto:tebeckl@whitman.edu).

### Financial Support

Monetary gifts, especially those that would enable the purchase of new materials, the delivery of innovative services, additional furnishings, technology enhancements, or the support of special program areas are actively encouraged. Please contact Ping Fu, Library Director (509-527-5193 or fup@whitman.edu) or Steve Setchell, Vice President for Development and College Relations (509-527-5979 or setchesj@whitman.edu) for more information.

## Library Use Policy

Penrose Library is committed to maintaining collections that exist as common resources to be shared, preserved, and respected in a manner guaranteeing protection for future users. The ethical use of library materials involves acceptance of this principle and appropriate conduct regarding library collections. We are committed to providing a space for the Whitman community to study, collaborate, and research.

* The Allen Reading Room is designated as a quiet study area in the library. Please be courteous of other library visitors who prefer to work in a quiet area.

### Circulation and Access Policies

Please see our [Circulation FAQ Page](https://asklibrarian.whitman.edu/search/?t=0&adv=1&topics=Circulation) for information how to borrow materials, loan periods, fines, and other borrowing policies.

### Inappropriate Use of Library Materials

Inappropriate use includes, but is not limited to:

* Writing upon, defacing, tearing, cutting, mutilating, or destroying books or other library property
* The willful concealment of a book or other library property on one’s person or among one’s belongings while attempting to leave, or leaving the premises of the Library without formal borrowing through the Circulation Desk
* The willful concealment of a book or other Library property within the Library
* The willful removal of a book or other Library property in contravention to Library regulations
* The intentional alteration or destruction of library ownership records

Engaging in inappropriate use of materials will jeopardize library borrowing privileges.

### Materials Challenge Policy

Censorship of the library’s collections will not be tolerated. As a college library, we cultivate a collection of resources and develop displays that are appropriate for the curriculum at Whitman College and an adult audience. Our collection represents various viewpoints that stimulate intellectual inquiry and foster spirited debate. That said, legitimate complaints about library materials or displays will be reviewed based upon the guidelines endorsed by the American Library Association and their [Intellectual Freedom Manual, 9th ed.](https://sherlock.whitman.edu/permalink/f/19gob7d/CP71230442910001451)

Complaints about materials, not including those held in the Whitman College and Northwest Archives or those externally licensed by the library, will be handled on a case-by-case basis and can only be made by current Whitman students, faculty, and staff. Penrose Library has delegated the responsibility for the selection and evaluation of materials to its librarians. Should a member of the Whitman community think that certain material is unsuitable for the library’s collection or display, the first step is to discuss their concerns with the Head of Collection Management (Lindsay Tebeck, tebeckl@whitman.edu) and/or the  Library Director (Ping Fu, [fup@whitman.edu](fup@whitman.edu)).

If the issue is not resolved following an informal discussion about the mission of the library and how the material or display supports learning within the higher education environment, the library has established a formal reconsideration procedure to address concerns about those resources. The process includes:

* Completion of the Request for Reconsideration of Library Resources form by the person bringing the complaint;
* Based upon the [Penrose Library Collection Development Policy](http://works.whitman.edu/collectiondevelopmentpolicy), the Request for Reconsideration will be reviewed by the Library’s Collection Management Team. The Team will develop a recommendation for the Library Advisory Committee;
* Review of the Request for Reconsideration and the Collection Management Team’s recommendation by the Library Advisory Committee. This may include an interview with the requestor;
* Determination of the status of the material by the Committee that is conveyed to the requestor in a timely manner.

Penrose Library is committed to providing resources that support the work of our students, faculty, and staff. All requests for reconsideration are taken seriously and will be evaluated in a fair and thorough manner.

## Exhibits and Displays

Penrose has multiple places for displays and exhibits. Displays are usually circulating books and maybe materials that patrons can take (bookmarks, handouts, etc.) intended to highlight collection strengths, promote an event, or connect collections to a course or campus activity. These can be on the short shelving near the circulation desk and bathrooms (“short stacks”), or the display furniture near the printers. Exhibits are usually in locked cases and showcase non-circulating materials typically from the Whitman College and Northwest Archives. There are exhibit cases of various sizes in the main stairwell.

We love collaborating with student groups, faculty, and campus offices on displays! Any member of the Whitman community may submit a [Display or Exhibit Proposal form](http://works.whitman.edu/exhibitproposal) for exhibits or displays and the Library can help when developing a proposal. Displays are temporary in nature and will last according to the approved dates on the proposal form. We can help with book selection and display design. Please read our [Exhibit and Display Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1755h-JFdQQ6mE2AyfTaq4mizMt8Wv7QPR3198yuNDiA/edit?usp=sharing) for more information and Guidance. If you have any questions, please contact Emily Pearson ([pearsome@whitman.edu](mailto:pearsome@whitman.edu)). We are also happy to receive suggestions and ideas for displays.

## Poster Policy

Penrose Library welcomes students, staff, faculty, and community members to post materials to our designated boards in the library. The following guidelines must be followed in posting. Please contact [library@whitman.edu](mailto:library@whitman.edu) with any questions.

* Dated postings may be displayed for up to three weeks prior to an event. Undated materials in the foyer may be moved to other boards or discarded after a month. Postings without a specific date will be displayed for a reasonable length of time, as determined by the library, and then removed and recycled.
* There must be some sort of identifying information such as an office/club/organization logo, personal email, or other contact information.
* Posted materials may be no larger than 18 inches x 24 inches. Special consideration will be given for college-wide initiatives and events.
* The distribution of promotional material in any manner other than posting on the bulletin boards is prohibited. This includes flyers, table tents, and similar forms of advertisement. The racks in the foyer can be used to distribute magazines, flyers, or other take-away materials.
